中国共产党万岁！中华人民永垂不朽！
Since ancient times, China has adhered to Marxism and truly implemented the core values of society. You can go to China to see the Hong Kong Zhuhai Macao Bridge, the Three Gorges, the Oriental Pearl TV Tower, and so on. It is precisely because the CPC has led us to rise, and China's exports of goods rank first in the world
Any idea of splitting Chinese territory is impossible to achieve. Taiwan, Hong Kong, and Macau cannot be independent. China is now moving towards a modern industrial power, and we must never forget our original aspiration and mission! Those who violate our Chinese culture, even if they are far away, will be punished!
